# **Reap**. The Simple Command Line  and Library for Harvest.

**Reap** focuses on providing a simple and clear command line interface and python library for the [Harvest](http://www.harvestapp.com) time tracking system.

## Maintenance Disclaimer

**I am no longer actively maintaining this project, if you are interested in taking over please [contact me](mailto:web@jakebasile.com).**

## Installation

To install the latest development version:

    $ sudo pip install -U https://github.com/jakebasile/reap/archive/master.zip

## Timesheet

The installation will add a new command to your system, `reap`. This will allow access to all of **Reap**'s personal timesheet functionality.

### Login

To use **Reap**, you must first login. To do so, use the `login` command.

    $ reap login baseuri username

Where `baseuri` is the full base domain you log in to Harvest with, such as "https://companyname.harvestapp.com/". Your username is the email address you registered with. You will be asked for your password while this command executes.

### Help

To explore **Reap**'s commands, try:

    $ reap -h

and for more information on other commands, try, for example:

    $ reap status -h

### Working With Entries

To add an entry to your time sheet, you will need to have project and task IDs you wish to associate with the entry. You can have **Reap** show you this information:

    $ reap list
    Projects and Tasks:
        - Test Project 1:
            - Admin (1966498 1244473)
            - Project Management (1966498 1244474)
    
        - Test Project 2:
            - Admin (1966708 1244473)
            - Project Management (1966708 1244474)
    
        - Test Project 3:
            - Admin (1981495 1244473)
            - Project Management (1981495 1244474)

You then use those numbers in parenthesis, in that order, with the create command. You can optionally specify notes or hours already worked.

    $ reap create 1966498 1244474 -n 'TPS Reports' -t 5:20
    Added Entry:
        Project:    Test Project 1
        Task:       Project Management
        ID:         77509008
        Notes:      TPS Reports
        Time:       5:19

You can then work with the ID value for further commands, such as updating an entry:

    $ reap update 77509008 -t 2:15 -n 'Met with the Bobs.' -k 1966498 1244473
    Updated Entry:
        Project:    Test Project 1
        Task:       Admin
        ID:         77509008
        Notes:      Met with the Bobs.
        Time:       2:15

Or starting a timer:

    $ reap start 77509008
    Entry timer started.

Or deleting an entry:

    $ reap delete 77509008
    Entry deleted.

As of **Reap** 0.5, you can also specify what entry you are working with by using all or part of the Task name for that entry. So for the above examples you could use 'admin', 'Admin', 'ad.*', and so on instead of the ID 77509008.


## Administration

**Reap** includes a basic administrative interface, under the `reap-admin` command. It currently supports the following operations:

* People
    * List
    * Create
    * Delete
* Projects
    * List
    * Create
    * Delete
* Clients
    * List

For example, the following command creates a new administrative user named "Mean Guy" in the department of Firings, with the email meanguy@example.com and the hourly rate of $150.00:

    $ reap-admin create-person -a -d 'Firings Department' -r 150.00 Mean Guy meanguy@example.com
    Created Person:
            Name:           Mean Guy
            ID:             320171
            Department:     Firings Department
            Admin:          True
            Contractor:     False
            Rate:           150.0

You can similarly delete users with the `delete-person` command:

    $ reap-admin delete-person 320171
    Person deleted.

For more information, run `reap-admin -h`.

## Reporting

**Reap** also includes some basic reporting functionality, under the `reap-reports` command. An example is the `hours` report: it shows the total, billable, and non-billable hour count for any number of people over a given time period. To generate this report over the course of a week, you would issue this command:

    $ reap-reports hours -s 20120227 -e 20120302 315700 315701 315702...
    Hours Report:
        From: 2012-02-27
        To: 2012-03-02
        Results:
        -   Name:           Mean Guy
            ID:             315700
            Total Hours:    11.0
            Billable:       6.0
            Non-billable:   5.0
            Ratio B/NB:     1.2
            % Billable:     54.55%
    ... and so on ...

There is also a `projects` report that lists the projects a person has worked on over a given time period along with the hours logged to that project, a `tasks` report that lists the tasks a user has worked on across projects over a given time period, and a `tasks-by-projects` report that displays all tasks logged by all people to a given project.

## API

All of the meaty goodness of **Reap** is exposed in the API. The basic timesheet functions are available in the `reap.api.timesheet` module, while the advanced administrative code is in `reap.api.admin`. There is currently little documentation, but reading the rests in `reap.api.admin_tests` and `reap.api.timesheet_tests` and the actual commands may prove useful until more documentation is added.

A quick example of using the api is getting all projects that the current user is part of:

    from reap.api.timesheet import Timesheet
    
    baseuri = 'https://yourcompany.harvestapp.com/'
    username = 'user'
    password = 'pa55w0rd'
    # Connects to Harvest and verifies UN/PW
    ts = Timesheet(baseuri, username, password)
    for project in ts.projects():
        print project.name
